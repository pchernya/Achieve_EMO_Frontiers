# Achieve_EMO_Frontiers
Repository accompanying the manuscript "Achievement emotions in kindergarten: The association of solution accuracy with discrete joy, sadness, and surprise", to appear in Frontiers in Psychology (https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1466345).

We provide the R markdown file for the anlaysis of discrete joy as a functional predictor. The analysis for discrete sadness and surprise are very similar. Mathematics strategy data that is merged with the encoded emotions data is currently under embargo by the funder (IES; USA) and cannot be shared. 

De-identified encoded emotions data may be shared following reasonable request to the contact author (traci.kutaka@virginia.edu) following existing data sharing and use agreements.
